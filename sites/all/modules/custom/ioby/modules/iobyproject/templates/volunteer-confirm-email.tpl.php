Hey there,

Thanks for expressing interest in volunteering for <?php print $form_vars['project_title'] ?>  on ioby.org.

We've passed along your inquiry to the project leader, who is in charge of following up on your message. It's up to the project leader (not ioby) to reach out to you and organize everything. If you don't hear anything back from the project leader in a few days you can email us at info@ioby.org and we'll try and help, but ultimately we can't be held responsible for coordinating your involvement with the project. 

Thanks for your interest in volunteering -- and thanks for supporting ioby!

The ioby team
